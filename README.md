# Module 1 Challenge

# User Story



AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines


## Acceptance Criteria


GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title


### Changes Made



* Changed title from "title" to "Horiseon Search-Engine-Optimization".
* Changed Semantics within the HTML to better reflect the content within.
* Fixed Broken link by adding an ID tag to "Search Engine Optimization".
* Added alt tags to all images within the HTML for accessibility and compliance.
* Made the HTML code more clear by adding comments, and cleaning up the structure. 
* Consolidated CSS elements, and commented changes.
